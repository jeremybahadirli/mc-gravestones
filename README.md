# Minecraft "Gravestones" Data Pack
Dead players spawn gravestones and may be revived with a special potion. For use on Hardcore worlds.
## Configuration:
- **Starter potions:** By default, the Gravestones Data Pack provides each player two *Potions of Undying* upon first joining the server. This can be adjusted in `mc-gravestones/data/jeremybahadirli/loot_tables/gameplay/initial_spawn.json`, by changing the bottom `rolls` value to be the number of potions provided.
